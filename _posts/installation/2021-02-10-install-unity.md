Learn how to install one the most widely used engines to develop Games and AR/VR applications. Unity can be used to develop games for all platforms.
By the end of this post, you will have Unity installed and be ready to work in the Unity environment.

> There are other gaming engines in the market, but we do not work with.
Sorry for that...

# Prerequisites
You should be already up to date, but double check that you have a **64 bits Windows 10**.
All requirements are on the [Unity website](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html)

# Steps

## Install Unity Hub
Unity Hub is a standalone application that streamlines the way you find, download, and manage your Unity Projects and installations.

You will use the Hub at least to:
  * Manage your Unity account and Editor licenses.
  * Create your Project, and manage the installation of multiple versions of the Editor.

[Download the Unity hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) then run it.

Depending your situation, you may have to acquire a license.
The great thing with the Unity Hub is that you don't have anything to choose except the install location.

> Don't change the name to Unity as this is the location used to install the Unity Engine (see below)

## Install Unity Editor
After Unity Hub is install, you should go to **Installs**, then click to **ADD** and select the version you want (or need).

> Tips: you can upgrade your existing projects, but **cannot downgrade**.
Be sure that the release you choose is the best one for your project

You can have several Unity release installed on your computer but for each, modules will be reinstalled.

## Install Modules
At least, I recommend having [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). 
It is a fully-featured, extensible, free IDE for creating modern applications for Android, iOS, Windows, as well as web applications and cloud services we will use later on.
Visual Studio Community is free as well as Visual Studio Code, but it is more easier to create and manage projects, from my point of view.

## Ready to create!
When the installation is done, I recommend you restarting your computer. It is not mandatory but it is a good practice to avoid installer running in background and providing bad performance for the first launch.

# Conclusion
You have been able to deploy by you own the Unity Hub and Unity Editor.
Welcome onboard!
